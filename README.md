# Selenium_Junit_Gmail-Sign-In

<p><span style="color: #0000ff; font-size: 20px;">Automation project using Selenium Web Driver on Gmail sign-in process.</span></p>

This is a practice project of Selenium Web Driver.

Here I tested Gmail signin process by opening gmail website and putting my gmail address.
But the test couln't go further because Gmail security blocked Firefox session. :(
